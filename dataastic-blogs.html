As I progressed in my career, I wanted to concentrate on strengthening a specific technical stream, adopting standard coding practices, and understanding more of software design and architecture. In short, the aim and effort revolved around upgrading only technical competency, ignoring domain knowledge.

	      	By 2021, the world is set to generate 50 times the amount of data as in 2011, according to a study by International Data Corporation (IDC). With this humongous amount of data and real business implications at play, business organizations across the world have the need for an easy-to-use tool to analyse data and derive actionable insights from it.

			Actionable insight is an end product and goal of a Tableau Analyst as well as a Data Scientist. Probably both are sailing in the same boat where making the right decision in the ocean of data is the goal simultaneously adding value to the business.
