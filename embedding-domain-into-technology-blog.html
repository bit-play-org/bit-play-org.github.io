	      	When I started my software career back in the late 90’s, the focus was primarily on understanding and improving technical skills. As I progressed in my career, I wanted to concentrate on strengthening a specific technical stream, adopting standard coding practices, and understanding more of software design and architecture. In short, the aim and effort revolved around upgrading only technical competency, ignoring domain knowledge.

			Those days, training a technically savvy developer in the business domain was more of an exception than a rule. In hindsight, during my professional career, the projects which I managed and developed would have excelled in terms of quality and design if my team or I had better knowledge and understanding of the business domain. 
Unfortunately, this has not changed much over the years, today as well, due to the absence of domain expertise, a fully developed robust application has to undergo multiple design changes till it is deployed in production. This is not only expensive but quite time consuming.

	      	Actually, the buck starts with our education system. Even today, the curriculum focuses on some vintage programming languages as against business case-driven teaching methodology and syllabus. Still, while shortlisting a candidate for a technical job, I do not see the candidate explaining the business behind his programming experience or a piece of code he or she has written. The reason being, he or she has no inclination to understand the business behind the computer programs he has written. Traditionally, the importance of Business or Domain knowledge is always discounted or undermined by technical teams (Programmers, DBA’s. Coders. Architect) assigned to a project.
Remember, the end product will always be of better quality and merit if technological expertise and domain knowledge are blended and applied by the programmer into building a project. For instance, when building an accounting software, having knowledge of the three golden rules of accounting is a guarantee of superior end product or it is important to know the difference between an acquirer and an issuer when you are designing a sub-module Architecture for a credit card company. 
Bridging the gap between business and technology is not easy, however there are software companies who have overcome this challenge successful, ensuring business and technology go hand in hand. One of the examples is concept of Business Rule Engines (BRE). Fierce competition in the last decade has made it imperative that the gap between technology and business is minimized as a result, the fallacy that a developer needs only technical knowledge and minimal domain knowledge is diminishing. I see more and more domain knowledge playing a dominant role in the success of a project, in the coming years. One more angle to having domain knowledge becoming more important is that it brings in commercial efficiency into the corporate hiring program. For instance, a pharmaceutical company will be recruiting a Java developer with good knowledge of the Healthcare field than just a Java developer, cutting down on the extra cost of recruiting additional domain experts.

	      	To summarize, are domain-knowledge building skills worth investing in? Absolutely Yes!! As a developer it seems to me that by mastering a domain, you’ll end up with a full-bodied holistic solution or product which has been thoroughly thought through from a domain as well as technical standpoint. On the other hand, if you're given a technical problem with no explanation as to why, I doubt you'll understand the purpose of it or know where to apply your technical skills.

	      	Grab the smallest of opportunities to learn business behind your technical execution. Very soon it’s going to become the most sort after skill you may possess in tandem with technical expertise.

	      	Whether you techies like it or not, the returns for implementing and maintaining technology comes from Business or in other words the budget to run and maintain the Information Technology department depends on how much business the company has made and not the other way round is a fact
