	      	Should software companies adopt the traditional coding approach or use No-code development platform (tool-based development) has been in debate for some period now.
	      </p>
	      <p class = "dataastic-article-contents">
	      	Back in the 1970‘s and 80’s, stitching of clothes was preferred to readymade apparels. As we entered into the millennium, international brands started making their way into India, even the indigenous brands started to gain momentum and the market for readymade apparels gained more popularity as compared to tailoring garments. 
	      </p>
	      <p class = "dataastic-article-contents">
	      	The reason for drawing parallels between apparels and Information technology is because software Product Development has more or less followed the same trajectory as the readymade garment industry for the past two decades. Although coding is the backbone of most of the software programs and applications, it can be complex, cumbersome to maintain and can no longer keep up with the speed of business. Modern ecosystems have become so complex, and marketplaces evolve so rapidly, that digital solutions become obsolete almost as soon as they're pushed live. With the emergence of No-code development platforms and intuitive tools, the ability to build and deploy apps quickly and efficiently has become need of every enterprise.
	      </p>
	      <p class = "dataastic-article-contents">
	      	The classic Economics principle of ‘Make vs buy’ has compelled IT giants to switch to tool-based development. Writing a code/program from scratch is more time consuming, cumbersome and adds to the cost of software organizations. It is economically viable for software organizations to opt for Buy as against Make.
	      </p>
	      <p class = "dataastic-article-contents">
	      	Enterprises are increasingly sidestepping editable codebases altogether and embracing visual programming approaches such as no-code reporting platforms like Tableau. It has opened multiple channels of opportunities for IT professionals who do not have coding or programming background.
	      </p>
	      <p class = "dataastic-article-contents">
	      	These tools are regarded as a form of visual programming. Instead of text-based development environments, users manipulate code elements through drag-and-drop user interfaces which are much easier to learn compared to getting a computer science degree or going through a coding boot camp.
	      </p>
	      <p class = "dataastic-article-contents">
		  	Besides this, it has been proven over the years that coding is not everybody’s cup of tea. However, in this day and age, with basic knowledge of the Software Development Life Cycle, we can leverage and exploit all the prominent attributes/features of any Tool based software, resulting in 95% fulfillment of client requirements, thereby building a satisfactory application.
		  </p>
		<p class = "dataastic-article-contents">
			In the last decade, reporting tools like Tableau have made tremendous progress to come close to competing with legacy coding languages through which reporting needs are fulfilled. Besides being one of the outstanding Visualization Analytic products, its user-friendly attribute and easy to learn with minimum to no coding background has made Tableau a go to tool for any organization dealing in Business Intelligence and Analytic space.

	  			The below Tableau example supports the fact that the tool does all the coding in back ground and the Developer just manipulates code elements/objects through drag-and-drop user interfaces.

	      <p class = "dataastic-article-contents">
	      	In the below figure 1.1, the Company Closing price text table shows company name ITC, WIPRO & SBI suffixed with csv. This is the extension of the file and we do not want this to appear on the chart.

	      	In short, the requirement is, company name value is suffixed with .csv and we just want to retain the company name and get rid of csv.  For instance, SBI.csv, we want only SBI to appear on the chart.

	      	With the use of drag and drop action, we can achieve this in less than 30 seconds. In the Tableau data panel, right click on the ‘Company name’ select Transform and then the custom split option. A pop- up window with Custom Split heading will appear prompting you to apply a delimiter. (As shown in Figure 1.2) The separator or delimiter you will use here is a dot(.)

	      	Once you click on ‘Ok’ on the Custom Split window, a field with the name of ‘Company Name - Split 1’ will be automatically created by Tableau. If we edit this field, we will see in the back ground Tableau has written a code using a combination of SPLIT and TRIM functions. 
	      </p>
	      <p class = "dataastic-article-contents">
	      	 As shown in the below figure 1.3

	      	 Last and final step is renaming ‘Company Name – Split 1’    to ‘Actual Company Name’ field and replacing ‘Company Name’ field with ‘Actual Company Name’ as shown in the below figure. 1.4

	      	 To conclude, this is the magic of using No-code development platform (tool-based development) built into Tableau. The above illustration is just one example out of many Tableau features/utilities. These utilities are frequently applied by Tableau Developers to save time and leveraged appropriately by Tableau Analyst, Tableau end Users & Tableau Professionals to build a Tableau application which will draw insights and make profitable business decisions.
