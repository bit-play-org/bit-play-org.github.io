	      	By 2021, the world is set to generate 50 times the amount of data as in 2011, according to a study by International Data Corporation (IDC). With this humongous amount of data and real business implications at play, business organizations across the world have the need for an easy-to-use tool to analyse data and derive actionable insights from it.
	      	</p>
	      <p class = "dataastic-article-contents">
			Actionable insight is an end product and goal of a Tableau Analyst as well as a Data Scientist. Probably both are sailing in the same boat where making the right decision in the ocean of data is the goal simultaneously adding value to the business.

	      	Giving the analogy of Cricket, a cricketer has to score runs, irrespective of what level of cricket he is playing whether it is Domestic, National, International, or IPL. Similarly, an Analyst has to draw key inferences from the data using methods, algorithms, or tools like Data Science, or Tableau. In this data universe, Data Science and Tableau have positioned themselves today where we can easily draw parallels between them and understand them more in detail. 
	      </p>
	      <p class = "dataastic-article-contents">
	      	Data Science is a blend of various tools, algorithms, and machine learning principles with the goal to discover hidden patterns. Tableau also does the same thing to some extent with limited data (as compared to Data Science ) and with built-in functions and algorithms and rapid result-oriented analytical features.

	      	I do understand, there are multiple components to Data Science as compared to Tableau and some of you might opine that we cannot compare apples and oranges. Well, I am not!  I would take the liberty to give a different flavour to this idiom in the context of Tableau and Data Science which are like lemons and oranges! Both of them belong to the citrus family. So I would easily make a statement to aspiring Data Scientists that as a first step, learning Tableau would aid to have a holistic understanding of what Data Science is all about.  In addition, it gives you clarity of thought, as to which component of Data Science you want to focus on or specialize keeping in mind the long-term career goal
	      </p>
	      <p class = "dataastic-article-contents">
	      	In fact, by knowing Tableau you have already covered few milestones in the career journey where becoming a Data Scientist is your destination.
Please note that learning tableau, you are not going to become a Data Scientist, the point I am making out here is 70- 80 % of holistic concepts of Data Science are touched upon while you learn Tableau. In other words, you are already on the path of becoming a Data Science professional if you have completed Tableau Training at DatAastic. 
	      </p>
	      <p class = "dataastic-article-contents">
	      	To understand this more in detail below is the outline of what are the common features or components which we grasp and understand when we learn Tableau
	      </p>
	      
	      <p class = "dataastic-article-subject">
	      	Data Engineering 
	      </p>
	      <p class = "dataastic-article-contents">
	      	<u>Structured Query Language</u>, <u>Data Preparation</u> Techniques, <u>Data Connectivity</u>, Data Processing all of these are features and concepts embedded into Tableau software to aid Tableau developers for easy and fast decision making. The Custom SQL functionality in Tableau enables the developer to modify the default SQL query and update the table in the required manner. <u>Tableau Prep Builder</u> is a tool in the Tableau product suite designed which helps preparing your data easy and intuitive. Tableau Prep Builder is used to combine, shape, and clean your data for analysis in Tableau with just clicks and drag & drop actions. 
	      </p>
	      <p class = "dataastic-article-subject">
	      	Statistical	
			</p>
		<p class = "dataastic-article-contents">	
			
			Tableau enables us to apply multiple types of statistical measures like <u>residuals</u>, <u>correlation</u>, <u>regression</u>, covariance, trend lines, and many more. Built-in Statistical Modelling, the basics of descriptive statistics, and how to implement them using the built-in functionalities are available and just a click away in Tableau. Regression technique and how to visualize it using a scatterplot, <u>moving average and Percentile</u> in quick Table calculation are widely applied using Tableau features and functions.
			
	      </p>
	      <p class = "dataastic-article-subject">
	      	Visual Analytics
			</p>
	      <p class = "dataastic-article-contents">
	      	Visual analytics is essentially the marriage of data analytics and visualizations. When a Tableau user/developer/Analyst manipulates the data, presents it in a visual form, and makes a decision based on the picture that’s <u>Visual Analytics</u>. Tableau itself is used as a visual Analytics component/tool in Data Science. Although there are lots of Visual Analytic tools in the market today but in my opinion, there is no better Visualization tool than Tableau. 
	      </p>
	      <p class = "dataastic-article-subject">
	      	Machine learning
			</p>
	      <p class = "dataastic-article-contents">
			<u>Predictive modeling</u> functions in Tableau use linear regression to build predictive models and generate predictions about your data. Two table calculations, Model_percentile and Model_Quantile, can generate predictions and surface relationships within your data. These are extremely useful to identify outliers, estimate values for sparse or missing data, and predict values for future time periods.
	      </p>
	      <p class = "dataastic-article-contents">
			<u>Clustering</u> in Tableau is another option that uses unsupervised machine learning for segmenting data, which is especially useful when a high number of variables need to be considered. <u>Cohort analyses</u> and explore different groupings to understand consumer preferences, cause and effect relationships, and what is likely to happen to members of a particular cohort over time. <u>Forecasting</u> in Tableau uses a technique known as exponential smoothing. Forecast algorithms try to find a regular pattern in measures that can be continued into the future. <u>External services integration</u>: R, MATLAB, and Python integrations provide the power and ease of use of Tableau’s front-end while allowing experts to leverage prior work in other platforms and handle nuanced statistical and machine learning needs. <u>Einstein Discovery</u> brings trusted predictions and recommendations to every Tableau user for smarter and accelerated decision-making. <u>Tableau and Aible</u> are a great way to supercharge your data with AI to create a seamless BI + AI experience.
	      </p>
	      <p class = "dataastic-article-contents">
			All the above concepts and components are covered in the Tableau Training Program at DatAastic taking you closer to Data Science in your career journey. 
	      </p>	      
	      <p class = "dataastic-article-contents">
			To summarize the Tableau Training Program at DatAastic conceptually and fundamentally makes you ready to fit into the shoes of a Data Science professional. However, few Data Science components like mastering at least one programming language, curiosity about playing with data, developing business acumen will fall in place if you are hungry and passionate about being enchanted by data.
