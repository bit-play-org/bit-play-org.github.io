	      	Tableau is a tool for telling stories visually to get insight from data which helps actionable decision making fast and easy.
One of the prominent answers to Why Tableau?  is its accessibility and community support. We can download Public version of Tableau (Free) within few seconds. With Tableau’s elementary knowledge, any individual   can create the below basic chart with no cost and minimal time and draw insights with personal data in maximum 5 steps
	      </p>
	      <p class = "dataastic-article-contents">
			The above Bar chart “My Electricity Expenses” is created in less than 5 minutes and with just a few clicks. Tableau can combine data sources, add filters, and visually guide you to make informed decisions about your expenses.
It is obvious glancing at the diagram, the months from   March to July, being summer the consumption of electric power is more than average. The average monthly bill is Rs 3168

	      <p class = "dataastic-article-subject">
	      	The chart has been depicted using 5 simple steps

	      	The first step in creating this Chart is the data and its cleansing.
The data source used for this illustration is credit card statement, download your credit card statement on your local drive. The data can be in any format, delimiter, excel, text, PDF, the best part is Tableau can connect to multiple live or extracted data sources. Once you connect to this file on your local drive, on the data source panel

	      <p class = "dataastic-article-subject">
	      	The second step involves filtering.
	      </p>
	      <p class = "dataastic-article-contents">
	      	The data (credit card statement) has multiple transactions and if we need transaction only pertaining to electricity payment using Tableau filter expression, we can build this bar chart with no programming knowledge 
	      </p>
	      <p class = "dataastic-article-subject">
	      	The third step is capturing

			Capturing the rows and columns on the canvas and then selecting the Bar chart from Show Me pane of Tableau.
	      </p>

	      	The fourth and last step 
	      </p>
	      <p class = "dataastic-article-contents">
	      	Let me explain what are the resources required to implement using Tableau to create this basis chart 
	      </p>
	      
	      <p class = "dataastic-article-contents">
	      	<b>Data:</b> Goes without saying this is your private data and only you would be privy to the outcome  
	      </p>
	      <p class = "dataastic-article-contents">
	      	<b>Tableau Public:</b> The Tableau Public is essentially a free version of Tableau visualization software. It allows you to use most of the software functions. You can create visualizations and connect to CSV, Text and Excel documents. However, the largest difference is that Tableau Public does not allow you to save your workbooks locally.

	      <p class = "dataastic-article-contents">
	      	<b>Machine requirement:</b>

	      	Individuals who want to start there career as a Information Technology  professinals this is a good starting point and if show hunger to learn sky is the limit once you enter the Data Analytics space.

	      <p class = "dataastic-article-contents">
	      	In short, we can embed use of Tableau software with minimum cost in our day-to-day life . calculators were replaced with Excel sheets and   I won’t be surprised if Tableau replaces Excel in long run because data analytics is here to stay and Tableau is more than a excel sheet in terms of drawing visual inferences.
