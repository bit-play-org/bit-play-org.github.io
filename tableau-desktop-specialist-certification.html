	      	In today’s technology driven world, IT Executives/Managers are swamped every day with new technology to help their company improve productivity, create frictionless supply chains, eliminate inefficiencies and better handle information overload.
Information Technology sector when it emerged was originally intended to act as a workforce reduction platform. However, on the contrary it has created more jobs.   Businesses are budgeting and spending millions of dollars in keeping pace with the latest technology. Adapting to newer technology is inevitable for organization to stay in business. The action taken for this progression is generating millions of technology centric jobs
In the coming decades, not moving in tandem with technology will be a huge disadvantage and hinder the professional growth of any average person, especially the Generation Z should embed technology as a body armor throughout their life which will help them to survive and stay technically alive.
At Dataastic, we reckon the same, hence the Tableau Student Program (TSP) curriculum is designed to ensure that the student starts the basics of Tableau as early 14 years old.
The course syllabus has been carefully designed keeping in mind the suitability to the age and the aptitude level of a school student.  Basic Software Technology aspects like Database, Data Warehousing and SQL have been incorporated as prerequisites for Tableau Student Program (TSP) 
In fact, Tableau is a very powerful reporting tool. It has the ability to take instruction from *Tableauer and internally codes them in fraction of seconds, Tableau Software converts the actions sent by *Tableauer into coding. He/She just needs to understand the basic concepts of Tableau and the business requirement in the application which he is working with and common logic sense. Tableau is flexible to let the *Tableauer code if he has flair for coding and Programming
*Tableauer : Once the candidate undergoes the Dataastic TSP,  the individual can be a Tableau Developer, Tableau Analyst, Tableau User even Tableau Trainer.
