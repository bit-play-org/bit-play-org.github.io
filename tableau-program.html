	      <p class = "dataastic-article-contents">The Information Technology sector, when it emerged, was originally intended to act as a workforce reduction platform. However, in contrast, it has created more jobs. Businesses are budgeting and spending millions of dollars to keep pace with the latest technology. You can’t do today's job with yesterday’s technology and be in business tomorrow. Adapting to newer technology is inevitable for an organization to stay in business. The action taken for this progression is generating millions of technology-centric jobs.

	      <p class = "dataastic-article-contents">Demand for IT professionals is growing at a very rapid pace. Emerging technology will provide a lot more opportunities where every job will have a technology element to it which can range from 10% to 100%. It’s a misconception that all IT professionals need to do computer programming. In today’s Business world the role range of a IT professional is quite wide, He or She can be Business Analyst, Business User, Subject Matter Expert, Project Manager, Data Statistician. Even the remuneration offered to these non- programming background professionals is not related to their coding or programming ability. They bring in a different skill set which is classified under IT professional.

	      <p class = "dataastic-article-contents">While the universities feel that they have trained their students for their future workplaces in various domains, many a times it has been observed by experts that the industry demands are not met by the university trainings. In fact, there exists a gap where the level of employability skills of graduates and entry level work requirements do not meet. Besides this, on an average, only 10% to 20% of freshers actually are skilled to apply their coding/programming knowledge of what they have learnt at the time of Engineering.
At Dataastic, the goal is to teach the student how a theoretical tableau feature/concept is applied in real life or Industry scenarios. Once you undergo the TEP at Dataastic, it’s not only a reporting tool you will master but, the holistic concepts of Business Intelligence, Data warehousing will be crystal clear to you to crack any interview in Data Engineering domain. The syllabus is aligned to Industry standards.
