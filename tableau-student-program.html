	      	The Information Technology sector, when it emerged, was originally intended to act as a workforce reduction platform. However, in contrast, it has created more jobs. Businesses are budgeting and spending millions of dollars to keep pace with the latest technology. You can’t do today's job with yesterday’s technology and be in business tomorrow. Adapting to newer technology is inevitable for an organization to stay in business. The action taken for this progression is generating millions of technology-centric jobs.
	      </p>
	      <p class = "dataastic-article-contents">
	      	In the coming decades, not moving in tandem with technology will be a huge disadvantage and hinder the professional growth of any average person, especially the Generation Z should embed technology as a body armor throughout their life, which will help them to survive and stay technically alive.
	      </p>
	      <p class = "dataastic-article-contents">
	      	At Dataastic, we reckon the same, hence the Tableau Student Program (TSP) curriculum is designed to ensure that the student starts the basics of Tableau as early as 14 years old.
	      </p>
	      <p class = "dataastic-article-contents">
	      	The course syllabus has been carefully designed keeping in mind the suitability to the age and the aptitude level of a school student.  Basic Software Technology aspects like Database, Data Warehousing and SQL have been incorporated as prerequisites for the Tableau Student Program (TSP) and will be covered in this training.

	      <p class = "dataastic-article-contents">
	      	Tableau is an amazing platform for seeing, understanding, and making key decisions based on the data! With it, a student with minimum computer knowledge will be able to carry out incredible data discovery, analysis, and storytelling after successfully undergoing TSP.  Students can accomplish these tasks and goals visually using an interface that is designed for a natural and seamless flow of thought and work. No need to write complex scripts or queries to leverage the power of Tableau. Tableau gives the ability for the students to interact with data in a visual environment and with simple drags and drops actions, translates the necessary queries and then are displayed visually to make correct decision.

	      	Once the candidate undergoes the Dataastic TSP, the candidate can be either a Tableau Developer, Tableau Analyst, Tableau User, even a Tableau Trainer. The job opportunities in reporting areas are tremendous, and the opportunities are just not limited to programming/coding. If you do not have liking for programming/coding, you can easily shift to role of Tableau Analyst, Tableau user, Tableau Tester profile after successful completion of Dataastic TSP  with reference to Job opportunities.
You can be part of Tableau Technology land scape even if you do not like coding or programming. How Tableau makes coding easy by just clicks is demonstrated in my Blog <a title = "Evolution of Reporting Tools" href = "./evolution-of-reporting-tool-blog.html">Evolution of Reporting Tools</a>.
